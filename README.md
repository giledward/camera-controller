control your computer using the camera
This Python program allows you to control your computer using hand gestures captured by your camera. The program uses computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures and maps them to specific computer actions. Moving your hands in front of the camera allows you to perform various tasks without needing physical input devices like a keyboard or mouse.

Disclaimer
This program is a fun project and might not provide perfect accuracy or be suitable for critical tasks. Always keep a backup input method (keyboard/mouse) to maintain control of your computer.
